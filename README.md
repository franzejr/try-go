An array in Go is a fixed length data type that contains a contiguous block of elements of the same type. 
This could be a built-in type such as integers and strings, or it can be a struct type.

Slice Internals

A slice is a data structure that provides a way for us to work with and manage collections of data. 
Slices are built around the concept of dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink as we see fit.
